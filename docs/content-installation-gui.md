# Installing content using GUI

## Prerequisites

You must have *SourceContentInstaller.exe* and *SourceContentUninstaller.exe* installed. If not, relaunch the *Source SDK Base Resources* installer and check *Source Content Installer* in the components page.

## Installing content

1. Go to your *Source SDK Base Resources* install location.
2. Launch *SourceContentInstaller.exe*.
3. Choose which component(s) to install.
4. Click *Install*.

> **Note:** The installer automatically detects installed Source games.
>
> **Note:** Some components require specific Source games to be installed. Move your cursor over a component to see what's required.  
>
> **Note:** If you see grayed components, it means you don't have the required game(s) installed.

## Uninstalling content

1. Go to your *Source SDK Base Resources* install location.
2. Launch *SourceContentUninstaller.exe*.
3. Choose which component(s) to uninstall.
4. Click *Install*. (This actually means uninstall)

> **Note:** The uninstaller currently doesn't support detecting any content previously installed, but uninstalling any content that wasn't previously installed is <u>safe and without effect</u>.
